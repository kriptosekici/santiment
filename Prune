Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Navigate to the Directory:
cd /opt/sanchain/readonly

This takes you to the directory where the node's data is stored.

Update Your Local Repository:
git pull

Ensuring you have the latest updates.

Stop the Node:
docker compose stop

It’s important to halt the node's operations before making changes to avoid any data corruption or loss.

Run the Cleanup Operation:
docker compose -f docker-compose-clean-geth.yml up -d

This command initiates a cleanup process for Geth, the Ethereum node software. It may take a couple of hours, but it's designed to prune unnecessary data safely.

Check the Cleanup Process:
docker logs sanchain_dev-geth_prune-1

After the cleanup process is complete, check the logs. If you see a line stating "State pruning successful" towards the end, you know the process has finished correctly.

Restart Your Node:
docker compose start

Finally, restart your node to resume its operations with a lighter load.
